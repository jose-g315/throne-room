# Throne-Room
## Description
School project using OpenGL to recreate the throne room from Game of Thrones.
<br>
The first two sections of https://learnopengl.com/ formed the basis of this project.
<br>
There was a project template which included some files which can be found at https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL.
Also, the cylinder files can be found at https://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_cylinder.html.
